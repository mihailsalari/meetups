# Alexei Panin - Passing a PHP interview, the view from both sides.

Being a senior, a junior or having another ninja title doesn't matter when you are in front of the interviewer. All interviews are different, and topics vary from "What is a variable" to "how would you create an OS in PHP". If you are ready to see the view from the other side of the table (the interviewer point of view) or the evaluation grid, you are welcome to this meetu'up.
